      I research CellGAN at Pimpri Chinchwad College of Engineering, Pune. This GAN synthesizes cytopathological images to boost patch-level classification in cervical cancer screening. Using a lightweight backbone with non-linear class mapping and a Skip-layer Global Context module, it remarkably enhances classification of cervical cell types like NILM, ASC-US, LSIL, ASC-H, and HSIL, improving diagnostic accuracy.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
