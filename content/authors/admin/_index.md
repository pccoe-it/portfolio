      I research CellGAN at Pimpri Chinchwad College of Engineering, Pune. This GAN synthesizes cytopathological images to boost patch-level classification in cervical cancer screening. Using a lightweight backbone with non-linear class mapping and a Skip-layer Global Context module, it remarkably enhances classification of cervical cell types like NILM, ASC-US, LSIL, ASC-H, and HSIL, improving diagnostic accuracy.
